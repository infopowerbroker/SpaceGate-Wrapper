# SpaceGate Wrapper

A quick helper-script for you to run Veracity's Spacegate Script to find the rare items!

What does it do?
----------------
If you are over level 15, this script will run through an easy planet (A-K) to try and find a primitave alien item (rare). 

It will attempt to buff up using a MayDay Supply Package, Clan Ballpit, and summon a Boner Batallion (if you have one).

If you find an item, it will update your snapshot.

How do I Get it?
----------------
First, install it by running this command in KoLmafia's graphical CLI:

<pre>
git checkout infopowerbroker/spacegate-wrapper release
</pre>

What will it Install?
---------------------
1) The helper script
2) Veracity Spacegate script (https://kolmafia.us/threads/spacegate.23335/)
3) AV-Snapshot script (https://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/vb/showthread.php?t=250707)

What can I configure?
--------------------
1) If you want it to find 11 salads for the trophy (currently set to false, you can set it to true at the top of the script)
2) If you want it to use a MayDay Supply Package (if available). Currently set to True, you can set it to false if you wish.

If you find all the items, reach out to IPB to add an additional goal. That is on the 'To-Do' list.
